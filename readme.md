# Toggle menu bar

![Toggl menu bar](assets/screenshot.png)

A dead simple webview to track time directly from your menu bar.

[Download dmg here](dist/toggl-menubar-app-1.0.0.dmg)

## Why?

The official app is great. Packed with features, that I dont use.
I wanted quick access to my current tracking status, as I mostly start from a browser click anyway.

This mini app (webview) allows me to quickly see what I am tracking from the menu bar.

## Future

Not much, basically this wont ever need an update.
